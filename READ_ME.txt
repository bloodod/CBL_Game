The implemented learning goals were:
1) Version control (git)

2) User experience (UX):
We got feedback from a few people who volunteered to play our game, while it was still on development. 
Most of them found the game mechanics really easy to understand play the game itself, 
however, most had complaints or criticism regarding our User Interface. 
At the start, we did not have a lot of the features that are now implemented. For example, the sound button was 
added recently due to complaints of song being too distracting. It was set at the maximum volume and the user
had no option to change the volume within the game. Next, the end page, that also shows your score and 
the highest score was added. 



Tutorial: The user will see numbers on the screen for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds the numbers disappear. 
The user must then click the numbers in order from low to high. If the user correctly clicks the numbers in the correct order
the user goes to the next round where an extra number is added. This continues until the user gets the order wrong or
clicks the wrong position. There is also a powerup that is a gamble and either shows
the position of the numbers or it ends the game with a 1/4 chance of showing the numbers.
